=== For Clients ===
Q: How do I book a service?
A: You can book a service by browsing our provider listings, selecting a provider, choosing a service from their profile, and then clicking the 'Book' button. You'll be prompted to select a date and time that works for you.

Q: What's the difference between booking a service and posting a job?
A: Booking a service is for when you've already found a provider and a specific service they offer. Posting a job is for when you have a specific task and want to receive applications from interested providers.

Q: What payment methods are accepted?
A: We support a variety of payment methods, including GCash, Maya, Debit/Credit Card, and Bank Transfer, all processed securely through our platform. Some providers may also offer cash on delivery.

Q: Is my payment secure?
A: Yes, all online payments are processed through a secure payment gateway. For manual payments, we hold the funds until you confirm the job is complete, providing an extra layer of security.

Q: Can I cancel or reschedule a booking?
A: Yes, you can cancel or request to reschedule a booking directly from your 'My Bookings' page. Please be aware of the provider's cancellation policy, as some fees may apply depending on the timing of the cancellation.

Q: How do I communicate with my service provider?
A: Once a booking is confirmed, you can use our built-in messaging system to communicate directly and securely with your provider to discuss any details.

A: Payout requests are processed every Saturday. You must have a minimum available balance of â‚±400 to be eligible for a payout. Please ensure your payout details are correctly set up in your profile.
