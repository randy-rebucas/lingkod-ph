# Subscription System Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

This guide ensures the subscription system is properly deployed and configured for production use.

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Firebase project configured with Firestore
- [ ] Firebase Admin SDK credentials set up
- [ ] Payment provider accounts configured (GCash, PayPal, Maya)
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Domain and SSL certificate ready

### 1. Environment Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key

# Payment Configuration
ADYEN_API_KEY=your-adyen-api-key
ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=your-merchant-account
ADYEN_ENVIRONMENT=live
ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=your-client-key
ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=your-hmac-key

PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your-paypal-client-id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-paypal-client-secret

# GCash Configuration
GCASH_ACCOUNT_NAME=Your Business Name
GCASH_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=your-gcash-number

# Maya Configuration

```

### 2. Database Setup

#### Initialize Subscription Plans

```bash
# Run the initialization script
npm run init-subscriptions
```

This will create:
- Provider subscription plans (Free, Pro, Trial)
- Client subscription plans (Free, Premium, Trial)
- Default feature configurations

#### Firestore Security Rules

Update your `firestore.rules` to include subscription collections:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Subscription Plans (read-only for users)
    match /subscriptionPlans/{planId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // Only admin can modify
    }
    
    match /clientSubscriptionPlans/{planId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // Only admin can modify
    }
    
    // Provider Subscriptions
    match /providerSubscriptions/{subscriptionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.providerId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.providerId;
    }
    
    // Client Subscriptions
    match /clientSubscriptions/{subscriptionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.clientId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.clientId;
    }
    
    // Usage Tracking
    match /subscriptionUsage/{usageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.providerId;
    }
    
    match /clientSubscriptionUsage/{usageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.clientId;
    }
    
    // Payment Records (read-only for users)
    match /subscriptionPayments/{paymentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.providerId;
      allow write: if false; // Only server can modify
    }
    
    match /clientSubscriptionPayments/{paymentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.clientId;
      allow write: if false; // Only server can modify
    }
  }
}
```
