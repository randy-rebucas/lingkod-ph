# Testing Status Summary

## Current Status
- **Total Test Suites**: 72
- **Passing**: 9 (12.5%)
- **Failing**: 63 (87.5%)
- **Total Tests**: 645
- **Passing Tests**: 191 (29.6%)
- **Failing Tests**: 454 (70.4%)

## Major Issues Identified

### 1. Mock Function Issues
- **Problem**: Tests are trying to call `mockReturnValue` on functions that aren't properly mocked
- **Affected**: Most page tests that use `useAuth` hook
- **Example Error**: `TypeError: mockUseAuth.mockReturnValue is not a function`

### 2. Component Import Issues
- **Problem**: Some components are undefined, suggesting import/export issues
- **Affected**: `PaymentMethodIcon`, `LanguageSwitcher`, `NotificationBell`
- **Example Error**: `Element type is invalid: expected a string... but got: undefined`

### 3. Firebase Mock Issues
- **Problem**: Firebase operations not returning expected results
- **Affected**: Action tests, data fetching tests
- **Example Error**: `providersSnapshot.forEach is not a function`

### 4. Server-Side API Issues
- **Problem**: `Request` and `Response` objects not defined in test environment
- **Affected**: Server action tests, rate limiter tests
- **Example Error**: `ReferenceError: Request is not defined`

## Working Tests

### âœ… Successfully Working
1. **Logo Component** - Basic rendering and className props
2. **UI Components** - Button, Input, Badge, Card, LoadingSpinner
3. **Utility Functions** - Some utils tests are passing
4. **Auth Utils** - Partial functionality working

### ðŸ”§ Partially Working
1. **Firebase Mocks** - Basic structure in place but needs refinement
2. **Component Mocks** - Removed from jest.setup.js to allow actual testing
3. **Translation Mocks** - Basic next-intl mocking working

## Recommendations for Minimal Design Approach

### Immediate Actions
1. **Focus on Core Components**: Test only the most critical components first
2. **Simplify Mock Strategy**: Use simpler mocks that don't try to replicate complex Firebase behavior
3. **Fix Import Issues**: Ensure all components are properly exported/imported
4. **Add Missing Polyfills**: Add Request/Response polyfills for server-side tests

### Test Categories by Priority
1. **High Priority**: Core UI components, utility functions
2. **Medium Priority**: Page components with simple rendering tests
3. **Low Priority**: Complex action tests, Firebase integration tests

### Minimal Test Strategy
- Test component rendering without complex interactions
- Mock external dependencies at the highest level possible
- Focus on user-visible functionality rather than internal implementation details
- Use snapshot tests for complex components where appropriate

## Next Steps
1. Fix the mock function issues by properly setting up Jest mocks
2. Resolve component import/export issues
3. Add missing polyfills for server-side APIs
4. Implement simplified Firebase mocks
5. Focus on getting basic rendering tests working first

## Files Modified
- `jest.setup.js` - Updated with better mocks and removed component mocks
- `jest.config.js` - Configured for Next.js and ES modules
- `package.json` - Added test scripts
- Various test files - Created comprehensive test suites

## Conclusion
The testing infrastructure is in place, but there are fundamental issues with mock setup that need to be resolved. The "minimal design" approach should focus on getting basic component rendering tests working first, then gradually adding more complex functionality tests.
